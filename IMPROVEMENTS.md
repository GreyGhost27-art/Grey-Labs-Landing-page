### 2. Add Preview Image
Create and add a preview image (1200x630px recommended):
- Save as `preview.jpg` in the root directory
- Update the image path in meta tags

### 3. Connect Contact Form
Update the `submitForm` function in `js/main.js` to connect to your backend:
```javascript
async submitForm(data) {
    const response = await fetch('YOUR_API_ENDPOINT', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(data)
    });
    return response.json();
}
```

- **Netlify Forms** - Built-in if hosting on Netlify
- **Firebase** - Google's backend service
- **Your own API** - Full control

### 4. Update Service Worker Path

```javascript
navigator.serviceWorker.register('/your-subdirectory/sw.js')
```

Add Google Analytics or another analytics service to track visitors.

### 6. Performance Testing
