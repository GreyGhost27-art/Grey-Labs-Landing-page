## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "3D scene not showing?"
- Make sure you added Spline embed code
- Check internet connection (Spline loads from CDN)
- Open browser console (F12) for errors

### "Colors look weird?"
- Make sure you used valid hex codes (#rrggbb)
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

### "Site won't deploy?"
- Make sure you uploaded whole `Website` folder
- Check all files are included
- Try different hosting (Vercel, GitHub Pages)

### "Looks broken on mobile?"
- Should be responsive by default
- Test on real device, not just browser resize
- Check browser console for errors

### "JavaScript not working?"
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Make sure `main.js` path is correct
- Try hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
